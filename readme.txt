The culmination of my blood, sweat and tears over the span of 2 weeks. I bring to you a ghost style mod for Quake 2. In this mod, the theme is trying to get through the game while avoiding combat. Avoiding combat is optional but there are a few punishments with proceeding to be aggresive. For example, mobs spawn ghosts on death. This mod has 4 distinct features, but only 3 are currently up and running. 

The featuers are: 

10 Weapon Mods:
Blaster : Blaster works like a stealth game thrown weapon. You shoot and monsters are attracted to your current location, you are given invisibility for a short duration to reposition while the monsters wonder where you are. 
Shotgun: The shotgun gives the player temporary invincibility if they are under 40 hp, this bonus is increased if the player is under 10hp. 
Super Shotgun: The super shotgun pushes enemies far away and deals no damage, this knockback also works on objects. You can set up explosives near enemies for some fun traps. 
Machinegun: The machinegun functions as a stun gun, enemies shot by tihs gun are stunned for a short duration allowing the player to gain some distance.
Chaingun: The chaingun has a pulling effect which works on both mobs and objects. Doing this can bring monsters closer to destroy or drag away behind you if you can dodge fast enough.
Grenade Launcher: The grenade launcher has simlpe edits, a larger blast radius that will damage you if you get too close to the live grenade.
Rocket Launcher: The rocket launcher now has rapid fire but reduced damage.
Hyper Blaster: The hyper blaster is a damaging gun that is silenced, monsters that haven't already spotted you won't hear the shots from this one as their allies drop. 
Railgun: The railgun inflicts a curse of multi spawn for enemy stroggs.
BFG: The BFG does the most damage and has an insanse explosion radius. It's meant for cleaning out rooms of enemies but costs large amounts of HP to fire. 

Ghosts spawn on enemy death:
Mutant : The mutant has become a big cuddly bear, he does no damage but makes a lot of noise and only really serves to annoy you for killing its living strogg friend.
Parasite: The parasite is spawned from monster death and it's main feature is to reduce the player damage by half for a certain amount of time. 
Gunner : The gunner has the ability to reel you in, he deals no damage but can come across as annoying if he pulls you towards live enemies who will do their best to kill you. 

5 Pickups that are meant to aid the player:
   Health Stim pack: The health stim pack grants the player invisibility and mobs are unable to see them. 
   Health Large Pack: This health pack grants the player a lighter body as they are able to jump higher and farther.
   Ammo Boxes: Ammo boxes remove the curse of the lethal weapons that feature sacrificing HP for large amounts of damage. 
   Jacket Armor:Jacket armor gievs the player some damage reflection, it doesn't kill enemies but does make it easier to do so. 
   Armor Shards: Armor shards hold the purpose of preventing ghost spawns for 5 monster deaths. Use it wisely, or don't. 

A way to defeat a boss without killing it:
  I couldn't get this feature working due to time constraints of the project.
